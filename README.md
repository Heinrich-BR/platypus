Platypus is a MOOSE-based application created to enable custom MOOSE
problems to be set up and solved using the
[MFEM](https://github.com/mfem/mfem) finite element library as an
alternative backend to libMesh. It is based off of the MOOSE
electromagnetics app
[Apollo](https://github.com/aurora-multiphysics/apollo) that uses MFEM
for solving electromagnetics problems in a variety of formulations.

Platypus is under active development and is being updated frequently.
