Platypus
=====

Platypus is a MOOSE-based application created to enable custom MOOSE problems to be set up and solved using the [MFEM](https://github.com/mfem/mfem) finite element library as an alternative backend to libMesh. It is based off of the MOOSE electromagnetics app [Apollo](https://github.com/aurora-multiphysics/apollo) that uses MFEM for solving electromagnetics problems in a variety of formulations.

Platypus is under active development and is being updated frequently.
